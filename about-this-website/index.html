    <p class="ct">This website is built using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
    <p class="ct">It was bootstrapped using <a href="https://github.com/mrmrs/jkl">jkl</a> by the wonderfully excitable <a href="https://github.com/mrmrs">mrmrs</a>.</p>
    <p class="ct">It used to have a <a href="/archives">blog</a> but was updated so rarely that it was kind of embarrassing.</p>
    <p class="ct">The code is all open source and can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jonathandean/jonathandean.github.io">GitHub</a>. Please feel free to clone the repository and use the source code to bootstrap your own website but don't copy my content or my branding, please.</p>
