<p class="intro">For us programmers, there aren't many hazards to our work. The exceptions are probably obesity (or at least a little beer belly or some love handles) and RSI. Here are some tips in dealing with the latter.</p>
<p class="intro"><em>Update 9/24/13:</em> You may be interested in this post: <a href="{% post_url 2013-09-24-the-slow-recovery-from-rsi %}">The Slow Recovery from RSI</a></p>
<h2>How I got here</h2>
<p>One of the things that was always constant for me until recently was having at least one, but usually a number of, side projects. Namely the recently shut down <a href="http://blog.humblevoice.com">Humble Voice</a>. I know that this is a common thing for most of us. Having this kind of side work was extremely beneficial for my career and was a lot of fun. However, I'm just now realizing the dark side.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago I started to realize that I was getting RSI, most often referred to as carpal tunnel syndrome when it's in the wrists, like I have. I did what I thought was sufficient and saw a doctor who confirmed that I had some time left before I would probably need surgery. He didn't find any nerve damage and that would have been the scariest thing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the conversation ended at deciding when to have surgery and alternative forms of treatment and how I should change the way I work were left out. He is an excellent doctor and surgeon but maybe this is a sign of some of the problems in our health care industry where surgery is often the first or only solution.</p>
<p>Now several years later my condition has gotten so bad that I can barely work a full eight hour day (and often much less) let alone be able to do side work on nights and weekends. This is the main reason why Humble Voice had to go offline.</p>
<h2>What is RSI?</h2>
<p>RSI stands for <em>Repetitive Stress Injury</em>. By definition this is an injury caused by repetitive motion. The most common form is what we also referred to as carpal tunnel syndrome. What's happening here is that the small repetitive motions of typing and moving a mouse are inflaming the tendons inside the carpal tunnel, which is a small passageway where a primary nerve runs through our wrist. This nerve becomes compressed by the inflammation and causes a variety of symptoms. Sometimes it will manifest as pain, other times as numbness, and (as is common with nerve conditions) the symptoms may happen away from the actual cause, such as in your hands, shoulders or even neck.</p><p>This is simply because the human body was not designed for this type of activity, it's something that we invented in recent decades. We are the first generation to have a serious problem with this condition and I think the future of computing will someday have to catch up.</p>
<p>RSI is not limited to typing either. RSI can happen many places in the body and are common in other professions such as musicians and athletes. (That's right, even us programmers can have sports injuries!)</p>
<h2>Ways to avoid and recover from RSI</h2>
<p> Trust me, you don't want to get in the position where you have to treat RSI. A coworker of mine described it best:</p>
<blockquote>Think of RSI like a bank account. You start off with a certain balance at the beginning of life. For some it may be higher than others because some of us are more prone to having the issue. But for all of us repetitive movements, especially typing and using the mouse, deduct money from this bank account. Each time we rest some money is added back in. If you push yourself too much you will end up overdrawing your account. Late fees rack up and it becomes harder and harder to have a positive balance.</blockquote>
<p>This is what it's like trying to battle RSI. In the way that us programmers work and are dedicated to working, this becomes not only a problem but very emotionally difficult. Since we can't stop typing, how can we avoid or treat the problem?</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>Take frequent breaks (and don't cheat!)</h3>
    <p>Because of the nature of the condition the best thing you can do is to take a lot of breaks while you work. At first this may be really challenging but can also be beneficial in other ways. For instance, consider adopting the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a>. This is a productivity hack that has the additional benefit of being perfect for avoiding RSI. I highly recommend giving this a shot if you find yourself working long hours. Not only does it help me avoid RSI pain, it's also been a very effective productivity tool!</p>
    <p>I also recommend using timer software on your computer, such as <a href="http://tech.inhelsinki.nl/antirsi/">Anti-RSI</a>, and not ignoring the breaks as they pop up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Good posture</h3>
    <p>Having a proper workstation setup can also make a big difference. You are more likely to have issues and swelling if your wrist are not straight and you have bad posture while you work. Unfortunately I think the laptop has caused a lot of us to work with poor posture. The straight keyboard layout ensures that your wrist are at an angle while you type, increasing the likelihood for inflammation. It also encourages us to do things like sit on couches or on the floor hunched over with our head down.</p>
    <p>You should always type with your wrists straight, your back straight, and your eyes looking directly ahead at your screen. This means you probably need an extra ergonomic keyboard (curved for better wrist position) and either your laptop screen elevated or an external monitor.  Don't take my word for it, look for yourself at <a href="http://www.webmd.com/back-pain/proper-sitting-posture-for-typing">WebMB</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Pair program</h3>
    <p>While beneficial in many other ways, pair programming can greatly reduce your risk for RSI and helps a lot of people recover from the problem. Good pair programming means that you are probably only typing for half of the time if your partner types for the rest. This means that even if you work long hours you are only risking the problem for half of them. Even better if you frequently rotate who's "driving" because long breaks are built-in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Use speech to text software</h3>
    <p>Using speech to text software is a challenge when it comes to writing code. But not all of your keystrokes come from writing code. In fact you'd be surprised how many other things you do, such as switching programs and windows, answering emails, typing in chat, etc.</p>
    <p>Good speech to text software, such as <a href="http://www.nuance.com/for-individuals/by-product/dragon-for-mac/index.htm">Dragon Dictate</a>, not only does dictation can also do many commands for you. You can also customize commands to do almost anything you need by having it execute key combinations and macros.</p>
    <p>Now I can just speak out loud to switch to my code editor, create a new file and create an empty Ruby class to get a jumpstart on what I'm working on. (This deserves an article of its own someday.)</p>
    <p><em>By the way, all of the content of this article is being written with the help of Dragon Dictate :)</em></p>

  <li>
    <h3>Avoid your mouse</h3>
    <p>I've noticed that mouse movements are often much greater than keyboard movements. If I end up using my mouse a lot it's always my mouse hand that hurts the most. I have even switched mouse hands and after a while it's the opposite hand that ends up hurting more. If I can avoid using my mouse as much as possible then I often have less trouble. For the times you absolutely cannot avoid the mouse consider switching hands from time to time. Using <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> for a while can be a great way to train yourself away from the mouse, even if you decide not to stick with it. For any editor be sure to pay attention to the common things you do and research if there's a way to do them in fewer keystrokes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Don't push through the pain</h3>
    <p>Once you start having pain pushing through it is only making matters worse. Going back to the bank analogy from before, it only gets worse once you're in the red. If you start having problems you should definitely stop for the day or at least find something else to keep you productive. Otherwise you're just going to suffer for it tomorrow and down the road and your overall productivity will be worse.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Common medical treatments</h2>
<p>I'm not a doctor so please be sure to consult one before starting any sort of medical treatment. I can only speak to what doctors have told me and to the treatments I've tried myself.</p>
<h4><em>Update 9/24/13:</em> Check out this post, where I also discuss how Chiropractic Therapy helped significantly: <a href="{% post_url 2013-09-24-the-slow-recovery-from-rsi %}">The Slow Recovery from RSI</a>.</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>Ice</h3>
    <p>The simplest and safest thing you can try yourself is to put a little bit of ice on your wrist. If you just have very minor inflammation that can help to reduce the swelling during your breaks. Just don't overdo it or you can cause tissue damage from exposure to extreme cold against your skin.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Anti-inflammatory shots and/or oral medication</h3>
    <p>You can also start with trying some over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications. However, if you're going to take these on a regular basis you still need to talk to your doctor. Many anti-inflammatory medications have long-term side effects if taken regularly.</p>
    <p>Your doctor may also start you on a steroid shot directly in the wrist or an oral steroid pack. The first time I did the steroid shots they seem to work but did not after that. I'm currently toward the end of a steroid pack, which is a high dose of steroid at first that is gradually lessened for about a month.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Physical Therapy</h3>
    <p>There is some physical therapy you can do before resorting to surgery. I'm currently doing PT now and generally do three things during my visit. One machine gently hits my arm with warm corn the consistency of sand in order to increase blood flow and aid in healing. I also spend some time resting my wrists and hands over a pad of infrared light that can help to heal damaged cells. Finally there is a device that detects where pain is coming from and does electrical stimulation.</p>
    <p>Since I'm still in the middle of physical therapy I have to report back on the progress of this later. It may be that I'm bad enough at this point that my results may be worse than yours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Surgery</h3>
    <p>The last resort for any condition should be surgery. Every surgery has some risk and in this case it means permanently severing a tendon that is very close to your nerves in order to give some more space in your carpal tunnel. They have become very good at this procedure but there is still an incision right next to your nerve. Any mistake and there goes your moneymakers so be sure that this is your last resort. Be wary of any doctor that insists you take this action before trying other things.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>I'm still trying to recover myself and am definitely not out of the woods yet. However thinking of the positives is definitely helpful. For instance, I more productive with the time I end am typing and more thoughtful with the work that I'm doing. I'm also able to take time to write a blog post, something I've been bad out for a very long time :)</p>
<p>I'm sure they'll be more on this topic to follow, for better or for worse.</p>
