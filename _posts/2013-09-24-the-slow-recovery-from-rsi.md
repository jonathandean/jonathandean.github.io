<p class="intro"><a href="{% post_url 2013-06-24-dealing-with-rsi %}">As mentioned previously</a>, I have been dealing with severe RSI for a while now. As I slowly recover, here are a few more things I've learned and some detail about what has helped and what hasn't.</p>

The recovery process for RSI, as expected, has been very slow. It's really hard to say what things have been helping and what haven't because a significant lifestyle change and changes in the way I work have been present during the entire process. I'm not ruling out the possibility that the true solution has been limiting my work hours and taking appropriate breaks throughout the day, as well as just learning to listen to my body to know when I'm pushing things too far. However, it does seem like a few things have worked significantly better than others.

It may also be worth noting that my RSI is not [carpal tunnel syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome) because the swelling and pain originates from elsewhere. Therefore I am not a candidate for [that particular surgery](http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/carpal-tunnel/open-carpal-tunnel-surgery-for-carpal-tunnel-syndrome). This is probably good because I've been desperate enough at times to go through with surgery if it were an option. That works for many but doesn't actually address the underlying problem. As far as I understand the issue could come back later because this surgery only makes a little more room for the nerve and doesn't address the cause itself.

It's also worth noting that this pain can be other very serious things, even if unlikely. I had a [Three Phase Bone Scan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_scintigraphy) to rule out things like cancer and find specific areas of inflammation. Please be sure to discuss with your doctor to see if there's any possibility of something more serious.


## What has been working for sure

*   __Taking frequent breaks during the day.__

    I recommend using a timer such as [Anti-RSI for the Mac](http://tech.inhelsinki.nl/antirsi/). If this seems too distracting consider trying out the [Pomodoro Technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) and setting the timers accordingly. You may just find yourself more productive than before.

*   __Limiting the number of hours and days I work.__

    I've learned that limiting myself to a normal eight hour workday and avoiding the computer over the weekend has made a huge impact. In fact, I have considerably less trouble on Mondays than Fridays. If I do try to skip that two day break I am in for serious trouble the following week. Same goes for having too long of a day. The bad thing about RSI is that once you push it too far it's much harder to recover from than it is to avoid in the first place. This has the added benefit of having significantly more clarity while I work and I often produce much better code as a result.

*   __Going to a chiropractor.__

    This one may seem unrelated but I was surprised by how effective this was for me. When the doctor took x-rays on my first visit, I had both improper curvature in my spine and a lack of the proper curvature in my neck. The nerves that run through your body all pass through your neck and spine to get to your brain.  When your neck and/or back are out of line they can cause serious issues with these nerves. My chiropractor had me write down, on a scale of 1 to 10, how severe my pain was in my neck, lower back, and arms before each visit. Looking at the card now I can see a very steady decline in these numbers at each visit. I went three days a week for a month and I have to say this was the most significant progress in my recovery to date. It was certainly the most progress I've made in a single month by a long shot. I fully believe that this had a lot to do with my recovery so far, though I certainly know that the first two points above were also significant and necessary. I also had some lower back pain while sitting and neck pain while sleeping that have both gone away, so I feel better overall by going. This is one of those things that can benefit everyone, RSI or not. We programmers sit and/or stand all day long and can really throw ourselves out of alignment.

    If you live in Pittsburgh, PA like I do, consider going to [Ploucha Chiropractic Center](http://www.mypittsburghchiro.com/) in the South Side. He has been working with me and knows how to deal with RSI and is good at explaining what he's doing and why. Tell him I sent you.


## Other things I've tried

*   __Previously mentioned__

    I won't reiterate what I already wrote, so take a look at the list in my previous post, [Dealing with RSI]({% post_url 2013-06-24-dealing-with-rsi %}).

*   __Acupunctureâ€Ž__

    I'm not ruling out the fact that this could have worked because honestly I did not go for very many sessions. What was promising here was that he put a needle deep into the inflamed tissue itself and electrically stimulated it in order to reduce swelling. This makes a lot of sense because I get some relief from my [TENS unit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcutaneous_electrical_nerve_stimulation) at home. This should work better because your skin and other tissue doesn't get in the way and absorb some of the electricity if you go directly into the inflamed area. However, I left each visit with more pain than when I arrived, presumably irritation and swelling from the needle itself. It's worth noting that this only happened in one arm and the other was fine. I also did not discuss this with the doctor to find out if it is normal or not. I wanted to, but there was a serious language barrier and he didn't really understand what I was asking. When the chiropractic therapy started to work I didn't look into finding another acupuncturist. Try this with caution. I have heard that it can help, it just didn't go well for me.


## Conclusion

Still working on it... it's a slow process.
