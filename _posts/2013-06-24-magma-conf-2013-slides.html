<p class="intro">A brief introduction and summary of my slides from Magma Conf 2013 on Inter-Application Communication and RESTful APIs for a Service Oriented Architecture.</p>
<h2>The story</h2>
<p>First, I'll give the same disclaimer I gave at the conference. The topic of a service oriented architecture is vast and complex and impossible to cover in its entirety in 35 minutes. Rather than trying to go very deep into every best practice, I chose to speak on some of the reasons for choosing a service oriented architecture and some very basic ways to get started for those that have no idea where to start. These slides are not intended to give you production code but rather a basic understanding of the concept and an easy starting point.</p>
<p>I feel that the most useful things to get out of conferences are ideas and inspiration. With the short amount of time that you have as an introduction to a topic there is no way you're going to become an expert. However, you can certainly be inspired and given a little knowledge in the right direction to start your own research and investigation.</p>
<p>For a similar reason, I try to outline some of the things we learned at <a href="http://stitchfix.com">Stitch Fix</a> to illustrate some of this as well.</p>
<h2>The slides</h2>
<p>As promised, here is where you can find the <a href="http://jonathandean.com/magmaconf-2013-inter-app-api/">slides</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jonathandean/magmaconf-2013-inter-app-api">source code for the samples and slides</a>.</p>
