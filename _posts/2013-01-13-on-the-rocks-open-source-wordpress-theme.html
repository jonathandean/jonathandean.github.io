On The Rocks is a bare bones WordPress theme designed for the slightly more hardcore. It's a little opinionated and may seem harsh at first, but is well-intended and actually quite inviting once you get used it. It's minimal but also very powerful and is certainly not for everyone. Designed for developers, it uses Bourbon and Neat. Really, it could only ever have had one name.
