<p class="intro">How to set your Heroku root domain to use SSL without setting an A record to a static IP and instead map it to your SSL endpoint.</p>

<p>If you've used <a title="Heroku" href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> in a production environment you may have noticed their avid <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/avoiding-naked-domains-dns-arecords">warnings about using a naked domain on the service</a>. This would be a domain like <em>example.com</em>, with no subdomains. They would prefer that all of your SSL traffic go to some type of subdomain, such as <em><strong>www.</strong>example.com</em> or <em><strong>secure.</strong>example.com</em>. However, that doesn't mean that all businesses (or I'd argue most) are able to require a subdomain (even <em>www</em>) for all traffic. You simply can't stop users from typing in <em>example.com</em> no matter how much you market <em><strong>www.</strong>example.com</em>.</p>
<p>You wouldn't know it from their support docs but there is a way to do it the right way. After discussing with their support team on several issues, here's the final solution.</p>

<p>Just to be very clear and up front, I'm not an SSL or DNS expert, but these solutions came from people who are. I try to elaborate on the "why" as much as possible but if you have an extra insight that I don't explain enough or don't explain properly, please let me know so that I can update the points here :)</p>
<h2>Setting up your SSL Endpoint</h2>
<p>If you aren't using SSL, just skip this section. Since you <em>should</em> be using SSL if you submit any sort of sensitive data to your app over the interwebs (passwords included) then you should probably do this.</p>
<p>First, do the steps to <a title="Acquire SSL Certificate" href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl#acquire-ssl-certificate">Acquire your SSL Certificate</a> and <a title="Set up the SSL Endpoint" href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl#add-your-ssl-addon">set up the SSL Endpoint</a> on your app if you haven't already. </p>
<h3>Problem with <em>heroku certs:add</em></h3>
<p>One thing that surprised me is that just using the standard <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl#add-the-certificate-to-your-app"><em>heroku certs:add</em></a> command caused there to be a missing chain certificate and therefore sometimes still throwing a browser warning about the certificate. I know basically nothing about this but I can tell you what I did the first time that was wrong.</p>
<p>I downloaded the certificate I purchased from Go Daddy that included two files: gd_bundle.crt and mydomain.com.crt. When I ran <em>heroku certs:add</em> I did it <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl#add-the-certificate-to-your-app">like the doc says</a>:</p>
{% highlight text %}heroku certs:add my domain.com.crt server.key{% endhighlight %}
<p>Unfortunately, I was getting SSL warnings in the browser still.</p>
<h3>Use SSL Doctor instead</h3>
<p>The problem appeared to be that in order to have the proper SSL trust chain, you also need to use the <em>gd_bundle.crt</em>. Apparently, "<a href="http://support.godaddy.com/groups/go-daddy-customers/forum/topic/what-is-gd_bundle-crt/">The <em>gd_bundle.crt</em> is an intermediate certificate bundle that is used to complete the chain of trust on your certificate installation</a>".</p>
<p>I'm not sure why it's not in their primary documentation or the primary way to add certificates, but Heroku created an <a title="SSL Doctor" href="https://github.com/heroku/heroku-ssl-doctor">SSL Doctor</a> tool to set this up properly for you</p>
<p>So install the plugin by running</p>
{% highlight text %}heroku plugins:install https://github.com/heroku/heroku-ssl-doctor.git{% endhighlight %}
<p>and then run</p>
{% highlight text%}heroku certs:add path/to/certs/*{% endhighlight %} where the <em>path/to/certs/</em> directory has your <em>gd_bundle.crt</em> (or whatever your SSL certificate authority gave you), the <em>yourdomain.com</em>.crt and your <em>server.key</em> file.</p>

<p>If you already set up your SSL endpoint and just need to fix it, use this instead:</p>
{% highlight text %}heroku certs:update path/to/certs/*{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Use a DNS provider that allows you to map your naked domain to a dynamic hostname</h2>
<p>The first issue to solve is that the typical setup of a naked domain on Heroku requires you to set your A record to three static IP addresses. The problem with this is that there is no failover ability if there is an issue with these IP addresses. If they go down or are under some sort of DOS attack, then your application goes down.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> today (June 23, 2013) it appears that Heroku no longer supports setting your A record their static IP addresses and no longer lists these IP addresses in their docs at all.</em></p>
<p>When you map a subdomain to your Heroku application's hostname using a <em>CNAME</em> record (for instance, mapping <em>www.example.com</em> to <em>example.herokuapp.com</em>) then Heroku has the ability to do whatever is needed behind the scenes to make the hostname available to you.</p>
<p>The other issue is that these three IP addresses go into their older <a title="Bamboo stack" href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/bamboo">Bamboo stack</a> and most new applications run on the <a title="Cedar stack" href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar">Cedar stack</a>, so there's some extra latency in your application when using these IP addresses.</p>
<p>Most DNS providers don't have the ability to use a <em>CNAME</em>-style mapping of your naked domain to a dynamic hostname like this. There are, however, at least three that do: <a title="DNSimple" href="https://dnsimple.com">DNSimple</a>, <a title="DNS Made Easy" href="http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com">DNS Made Easy</a>, and <a title="Amazon Web Services' Route 53" href="http://aws.amazon.com/route53/">Amazon Web Services' Route 53</a>.</p>
<p>I've had my eye on DNSimple for a while, so I opted to go with them. Their interface seems to imply that you need to transfer registration of your domain to them but that's not really the case. I kept the domain registered at Go Daddy but changed to their name servers, however, I will probably also transfer registration to them as well when it's time to renew. Waiting to transfer registrars also makes this possible <a href="http://support.dnsimple.com/questions/22223-How-do-I-transfer-a-domain-without-downtime">without any downtime for the domain</a>.</p>
<p>The record you want to add at DNSimple is an <em>ALIAS</em> record rather than an A record. They act the same way but with <em>ALIAS</em> you are mapping to a dynamic hostname rather than an IP. So trash the three A records for your domain pointing to Heroku's IP addresses if you have them already and add one <em>ALIAS</em> record for your naked domain (<em>example.com</em>) pointing to <em>your-ssl-endpoint.herokussl.com</em> if you are using SSL or <em>yourapp.herokuapp.com</em> if you aren't using an SSL certificate.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if all of those providers call that record an <em>ALIAS</em> record, so my apologies if they call it something else.</p>
<h2>Set up the www subdomain</h2>
<p>Just like Heroku says, create a <em>CNAME</em> record that maps the <em>www</em> subdomain to <em>your-ssl-endpoint.herokussl.com</em> if you are using SSL or <em>yourapp.herokuapp.com</em> if you aren't using an SSL certificate. You may also want to consider taking Heroku's advice and redirect all naked domain traffic to use <em>www</em> as well. I'm assuming there is some sort of internal latency and/or extra possibility of failure on your DNS providers side when it comes to the <em>ALIAS</em> record since it has to internally look up an IP to return for the naked domain.</p>
