If you've used <a title="Heroku" href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> in a production environment you may have noticed their avid <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/avoiding-naked-domains-dns-arecords">warnings about using a naked domain on the service</a>. This would be a domain like example.com, with no subdomains, including the www subdomain. However, that doesn't mean that all businesses (or I'd argue most) are able to require a subdomain, even www, for all traffic. You simply can't stop users from typing in example.com no matter how much you market www.example.com. They have sound points as to why you want to avoid them but there are a few tricks to make this work as reliably and securely as possible. After discussing with their support team on several issues, here's the final solution.<!--more-->

Just to be very clear and up front, I'm not an SSL or DNS expert, but these solutions came from people who are. I try to elaborate on the "why" as much as possible but if you have an extra insight that I don't explain enough or don't explain properly, please let me know so that I can update the points here :)
<h2>Setting up your SSL Endpoint</h2>
If you aren't using SSL, just skip this section. Since you <em>should</em> be using SSL if you submit any sort of sensitive data to your app over the interwebs (passwords included) then you should probably do this. First, do the steps to <a title="Acquire SSL Certificate" href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl#acquire-ssl-certificate">Acquire your SSL Certificate</a> and <a title="Set up the SSL Endpoint" href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl#add-your-ssl-addon">set up the SSL Endpoint</a> on your app if you haven't already. One thing that surprised me is that just using the standard <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl#add-the-certificate-to-your-app"><em>heroku certs:add</em></a> command caused there to be a missing chain certificate and therefore sometimes still throwing a browser warning about the certificate. I know basically nothing about this but I can tell you what I did the first time that was wrong. I downloaded the certificate I purchased from Go Daddy that included two files: gd_bundle.crt and mydomain.com.crt. When I ran <em>heroku certs:add</em> I did it as <em>heroku certs:add </em><em>my domain.com.crt server.key</em> <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl#add-the-certificate-to-your-app">like the doc says</a>. I guess what I was missing was the gd_bundle.crt to have the proper SSL trust chain. Apparently, "<a href="http://support.godaddy.com/groups/go-daddy-customers/forum/topic/what-is-gd_bundle-crt/">The gd_bundle.crt is an intermediate certificate bundle that is used to complete the chain of trust on your certificate installation</a>". I'm not sure why it's not in their primary documentation or the primary way to add certificates, but Heroku created an <a title="SSL Doctor" href="https://github.com/heroku/heroku-ssl-doctor">SSL Doctor</a> tool to set this up properly for you. So install the plugin by running <em>heroku plugins:install https://github.com/heroku/heroku-ssl-doctor.git</em> and then run <em>heroku certs:add path/to/certs/*</em> where the path/to/certs/ directory has your gd_bundle.crt (or whatever your SSL certificate authority gave you), the <em>yourdomain.com</em>.crt and your server.key file. If you already set up your SSL endpoint and just need to fix it, use <em>heroku certs:update path/to/certs/*</em> instead.

<em><strong>Update: the following has been fixed in the </strong></em><strong>heroku</strong><em><strong> repo, so the following isn't necessary anymore. I'll keep it in case you have an older version installed and have issues:</strong> (Notice I used the </em>wuputah<em> fork of the plugin on this. That's because with the </em>heroku<em> version at the time of this writing, all of my Heroku tools shit the bed complaining about a missing json gem and completely hosed my Heroku tools installation. <a title="Jonathan Dance (wuputah)" href="https://github.com/wuputah">Jonathan Dance (wuputah)</a> did a fork for me that included a vendored json gem and this one worked for me. I'm running on OS X Mountain Lion and the Heroku tools use the system Ruby as to not affect your development environment. I recommend using the </em>wuputah<em> fork at least until the </em>heroku<em> version pulls in <a href="https://github.com/wuputah/heroku-ssl-doctor/commit/a3e0c570c2c9491b6879610b4b0dba1d998b19cb">this commit</a> or it otherwise no longer becomes an issue. If you use the </em>heroku<em> version and have issues with it, just remove the plugin by running rm -rf ~/.heroku/plugins/heroku-ssl-doctor or reinstall your <a title="Heroku Toolbelt" href="https://toolbelt.heroku.com">Heroku Toolbelt</a> by downloading and installing it again. If this post is already a little old, maybe try the original </em>heroku<em> version first just in case the fork isn't up to date. Thanks <a title="Jonathan Dance" href="http://www.wuputah.com">JD</a>!)</em>
<h2>Use a DNS provider that allows you to map your naked domain to a dynamic hostname</h2>
The first issue to solve is that the typical setup of a naked domain on Heroku requires you to set your A record to three static IP addresses. The problem with this is that there is no failover ability if there is an issue with these IP addresses. If they go down or are under some sort of DOS attack, then your application goes down. When you map a subdomain to your Heroku application's hostname using a CNAME record (for instance, mapping www.example.com to example.herokuapp.com) then Heroku has the ability to do whatever is needed behind the scenes to make the hostname available to you. The other issue is that these three IP addresses go into their older <a title="Bamboo stack" href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/bamboo">Bamboo stack</a> and most new applications run on the <a title="Cedar stack" href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar">Cedar stack</a>, so there's some extra latency in your application when using these IP addresses. Most DNS providers don't have the ability to use a CNAME-style mapping of your naked domain to a dynamic hostname like this. There are, however, at least three that do: <a title="DNSimple" href="https://dnsimple.com">DNSimple</a>, <a title="DNS Made Easy" href="http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com">DNS Made Easy</a>, and <a title="Amazon Web Services' Route 53" href="http://aws.amazon.com/route53/">Amazon Web Services' Route 53</a>. I've had my eye on DNSimple for a while, so I opted to go with them. Their interface seems to imply that you need to transfer registration of your domain to them but that's not really the case. I kept the domain registered at Go Daddy but changed to their name servers, however, I will probably also transfer registration to them as well when it's time to renew. Waiting to transfer registrars also makes this possible <a href="http://support.dnsimple.com/questions/22223-How-do-I-transfer-a-domain-without-downtime">without any downtime for the domain</a>. The record you want to add a DNSimple is an ALIAS record rather than an A record. They act the same way but with ALIAS you are mapping to a dynamic hostname rather than an IP. So trash the three A records for your domain pointing to Heroku's IP addresses and add one ALIAS record for your naked domain pointing to <em>your-ssl-endpoint.herokussl.com</em> if you are using SSL or <em>yourapp.herokuapp.com</em> if you aren't using an SSL certificate. I'm not sure if all of those providers call that record an ALIAS record, so my apologies if they call it something else.
<h2>Set up the www subdomain</h2>
Just like Heroku says, create a CNAME record that maps the <em>www</em> subdomain to <em>your-ssl-endpoint.herokussl.com</em> if you are using SSL or <em>yourapp.herokuapp.com</em> if you aren't using an SSL certificate. You may also want to consider taking Heroku's advice and redirect all naked domain traffic to use www as well. I'm assuming there is some sort of internal latency and/or extra possibility of failure on your DNS providers side when it comes to the ALIAS record since it has to internally look up an IP to return for the naked domain.
