<p>I first went looking for a solution as to why connecting to FTP on my new CentOS 5.3 server was very slow. I found this post that had the answer: <a href="http://www.electrictoolbox.com/directory-listing-slow-ftp-server-centos/">http://www.electrictoolbox.com/directory-listing-slow-ftp-server-centos/</a></p>

<p>The gist of it is to edit <em>/etc/sysconfig/iptables-config</em> and add the following:</p>

<code>IPTABLES_MODULES="ip_conntrack_ftp"</code>

<p><strong>However, the big lesson here is that if you reload your iptables now you may end up losing a lot of your rules.</strong> In fact I did this and my website (and every other service) immediately was unable to connect. I was <em>extremely</em> lucky that I was just playing around a few minutes before with how to back up the existing rules. So before you do anything with iptables, run this first to export your currently active rules:</p>

<p><code>iptables-save -c > /etc/iptables-save</code></p>

<p>Now proceed to reloading your iptables-config:</p>

<code>/etc/init.d/iptables restart</code>

<p>Then make sure to re-apply the rules you saved with iptables-save by using iptables-restore:</p>

<code>cat /etc/iptables-save | iptables-restore -c</code>

<p>Now I don't pretend to be any expert on iptables. I'm sure that someone very experienced with iptables will be able to tell that right away and maybe even provide a better solution. I just know that my limited experience tells me that the rules I have set in my iptables config files are less than what's actually active right now. My guess (and I cannot confirm this) is that Plesk applied many of the rules I had in place. I had also applied a few of my own rules using the iptables command and I didn't edit any config files so that was my first hint that what is actually running at the moment is not from config files alone.</p>

<p>So unless you are very experienced with iptables, do yourself a favor and use iptables-save before making any changes to your config files and/or restarting iptables.</p>
