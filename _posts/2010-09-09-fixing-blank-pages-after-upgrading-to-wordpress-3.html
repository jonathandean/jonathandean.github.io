Today I finally clicked the auto-upgrade button to upgrade my WordPress site to the newest version, 3.0.1. I then noticed that I wasn't seeing the content of a lot of my pages. I could still see the lists of posts but I wasn't getting anything on a single post or normal page. I verified the data was in the database.

Here's what my page.php looked like:
{% highlight php %}
&lt;?php get_header(); ?&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;pageWrapper&quot;&gt;
	&lt;h2&gt;&lt;?php the_title(); ?&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	&lt;?php the_content(); ?&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;?php get_footer(); ?&gt;
{% endhighlight %}


This was all fine and dandy for WordPress 2.x but obviously wasn't working for 3.0. Turns out the solution is quite simple. I just need to put the_content() back into <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop">&quot;the loop&quot;</a>:

{% highlight php %}
&lt;?php get_header(); ?&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;pageWrapper&quot;&gt;
	&lt;?php if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;&lt;?php the_title(); ?&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;?php the_content(); ?&gt;
	&lt;?php endwhile; endif; ?&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;?php get_footer(); ?&gt;
{% endhighlight %}


I'm not sure why the change but I suppose I should have always explicitly used <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop">&quot;the loop&quot;</a>. Maybe I was taking advantage of a bug this whole time? Or maybe this was an intentional change that I should have seen coming. At any rate, if you see your content missing after an upgrade, take a look at your theme and make sure the_content() is always inside <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop">&quot;the loop&quot;</a>.
