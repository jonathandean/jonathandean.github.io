<h2>Part 2: The equipment?</h2>
Here's the first thing I completely fuck up. I'm pretty convinced by now that I don't know anyone that plays hockey and that Google is my only source of information on what to do next. Leave me alone, I'm programmer, OK? The interwebs are basically all I know. Anyway, so my first task is to buy some equipment. <a title="hello, swooning" href="http://helloswooning.com">Kristin</a> was kind enough to get me a helmet, a bag, a practice jersey and a mouthguard. I have to get the rest. So what do I do? I go to Google to figure out what in the hell else I need to buy. This works OK and I do pretty much figure out everything that a hockey player wears on the ice. This is a Sunday evening and I'm pretty excited now to pick this stuff up and try it on because I'm huge nerd and huge nerds do things like that. But I committed what I know now to be pretty much a sin: I went to <a title="Dick's Sporting Goods" href="http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/">Dick's</a> to try to find this stuff. The thing is, I did not realize that there are stores that specialize in selling hockey equipment and that nearly every employee has played hockey since they were two. So let me warn you now: if you or your child is getting into the sport, go to one of these stores. If they also sell basketballs, baseball bats or football helmets, don't go there. Just trust me on this one. Hockey is a hard sport and skating in the most important part of it. Sure you have to know how to shoot, how to check, the rules, etc. But if you can't skate, you can't play hockey. And if you have the wrong skates or they don't fit you, learning to skate will not only be hard, but you might get hurt. So step 1: find the right skates. There are two problems with going to a sports superstore like Dick's, aside from the sort of lame selection of skates. The first is that they don't know how to help you fit them properly. You can't just grab these off of a shelf, kind of put them on and then walk out. There is a particular way to fit skates to ensure that they are safe and won't hurt your feet. The second is that hockey skates must be baked to fit your feet. That's right, they are made of a special material that, when heated, will form to your foot and provide maximum comfort and minimize foot movement inside the boot. Dick's, as far as I know, doesn't have the special oven to bake them. No one at the register even knows to tell you that you have to take them to a hockey store to get this done later. Also what you find out later: it will cost you $30-50 bucks to have them baked elsewhere and a hockey shop will do this for free when you buy from them. So unless you're picking up an emergency replacement stick or some pucks or something, just don't go to Dick's for hockey equipment, and especially skates.

OK, rant over for now. Let's get back to what this idiot actually did, rather than what he should have done.

So I have a little list of the stuff I need to buy and I basically just walk down the very small isle of hockey equipment and start throwing stuff in my cart. They have basically two selections of everything there, one Bauer and one Reebok. Not that surprising for a sporting goods superstore, considering Bauer is owned by Nike now and Reebok is, well, Reebok. Then I realize, wait a minute, I have no idea if any of this fits. So I start putting things on and I have no idea what fits and doesn't. Should the gloves be loose or tight or just right? What's this going to feel like on the ice? What the hell to do I wear under this stuff? Under Armour, nothing? (Hey, Jon, here's an idea: put this shit back and go to a hockey store where someone knows the answers and can fit this stuff for you. Right? No.) So this whole process of picking up equipment takes something like two hours of wandering aimlessly in a single isle in a sporting goods store. Google helps me shop because I couldn't find a single employee to help the entire time I was there, even when I went searching for one.
