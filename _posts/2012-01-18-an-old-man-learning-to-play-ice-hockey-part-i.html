<h2>Part 1: The Introduction</h2>
<p>As a kid I was never very interested in playing organized sports. Sure, I played pick up games with the kids around the neighborhood all the time. Football, street hockey, you name it. But in general, playing for an organized team was never very high on my priority list. That is with the exception of one sport: ice hockey. It was the era of Mario Lemieux, Jaromir Jagr and two Stanley Cups, after all. The problem, as I'm learning now, is that playing ice hockey is fucking expensive. Sorry for the language, but trust me, it's expensive enough to earn an expletive. Anyway, my parents could never afford it, though I know they wanted to. It was easy enough for me to forget it though and I eventually retreated happily to playing punk rock as my after-school activity of choice.</p>

<p>Fast forward fifteen or so years and here I am at the end of my rock and roll days. By now years of abuse with a keyboard and mouse have turned my playings hands into weak reminders of their former glory. As my carpal tunnel progressed, I started to play less and less music and eventually the inevitable and predictable adult male interest disease started to take hold of me: I got back into sports. Of course it started again as being a spectator. I was gradually having more and more interest in watching. It's hard to avoid the Steelers in Pittsburgh and so I would watch a game on occasion with more and more interest. That is until the Steelers made the run to Super Bowl XL and solidified my necessity to never miss a game again. To be clear, it's not that I was ever anti-sports, it just wasn't a priority for me for many years.</p>

<p>Another thing happened to the world of Pittsburgh sports around that same time: enter Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and a new era in Pittsburgh hockey.</p>

<p>But about two years ago I started to realize something. If I didn't do something about it soon, I would never fulfill my childhood fantasy to play ice hockey. Of course I knew I was way too old to really do anything with it, but at this point I was going to be happy with just getting on the ice with a stick and a puck and having some fun. The problem is, I had no idea where to start.</p>

<p>Now jump to today. In my usual fashion, I've been talking about doing something for a couple of years. Anyone that knows me really well knows that I will hesitate and second-guess and procrastinate my way past retirement age before finally regretting that I never did anything about it. The good news is, <a title="hello, swooning" href="http://helloswooning.com">my girlfriend</a> does know me very well. And this year for Christmas, she got me the most expensive Christmas present I will ever receive: hockey lessons. Not expensive for her, mind you, this gift cost me a small fortune!</p>

<p>So here I am, years past my prime, taking my first ice hockey lessons. The good news is that I'm not actually horrible at casual ice skating. As a kid I loved my rollerblades and was always the only kid wearing them while we played street hockey. (Incidentally, this also could be why I was so bad at playing street hockey.) I can skate forward at a decent clip, foot over foot in a turn, etc. The problem is: that's less than half of the story when it comes to skating for hockey. You have to be able to stop, first of all, and that's a big problem for me. And not only stop in one direction but either way you are facing. You don't really want to have your back to the puck when you pull up on it because you can only stop on your right leg, right? And skate backwards. I can sort of do this in the way a dog can sort of walk on it's hind legs when it begs for a treat. It's slow, awkward and completely unnatural. Clearly, I have some work to do.</p>
