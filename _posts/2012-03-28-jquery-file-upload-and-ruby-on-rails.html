<p>Here's a basic recipe for using the awesome <a href="http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/">jQuery File Upload</a> in a <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> application. <strong>Warning: </strong>I haven't tested this code directly and should be treated as pseudo code until I have time to test in a fresh app. The general idea should get you started though, as I actually do have this working in an app. I just haven't tested with the application-specific logic pulled out so I may have made some slight omissions/mistakes.</p>

<p>Let's assume you have <strong>Document</strong> model with a <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip">Paperclip</a> attachment named <strong>attachment</strong> where you intend to save the files you upload. I'm also assuming you have a standard RESTful Rails application setup according to Rails convention.</p>

<p>In your <strong>DocumentsController</strong>'s <strong>create</strong> method (I'm leaving out the extra's for testing existence of the params, etc. just to keep it short and illustrate the point):</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
class DocumentsController < ApplicationController
  def new
  end
  def create
    errors = documents = []
    params[:files].each do |file|
      document = Document.create( :attachment => file )
      if document.errors.any?
        errors << document
      else
        documents << document
      end
    end
    # Do what you need with documents and errors here (set flash messages for the user, etc.)
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
