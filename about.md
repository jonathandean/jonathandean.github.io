I'm a Director of Engineering at [Stitch Fix](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com) where I currently lead the Styling and Client Experience (customer service) engineering teams. At Stitch Fix we combine data science with a human touch to deliver a truly personalized personal stylist experience and my teams build the internal systems where the two come together. Located in and originally from [Pittsburgh, PA](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/about-pittsburgh/technology-in-pittsburgh/).
